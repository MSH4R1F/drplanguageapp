## Problem Outline:
Language Attrition - the process of decreasing proficiency in or losing a language - is a significant problem that immigrant families face in multicultural areas. Captured succintly by the quote "First Generation Speaks, Second Understands, Third Loses the Language", it captures a common pattern where the desire to integrate into a new society leads families to adopt the dominant language of the host country, for example English. 

From the many benefits of safeguarding and preserving a child's heritage language is educational advancement, the skills learned in a heritage language can transfer to the dominant language, like English. This can lead to stronger literacy skills and even better understanding of content than people of a similar age. It also builds a healthy cultural identity -  children who maintain their heritage language feel closer to their cultural roots, fostering a healthy sense of identity and belonging, as well as academic and professional advantages - bilingualism can increase job competitiveness in today's globalized world!

## Opportunity Statement
How might we prevent the loss of language through a simple learning method with a small time commitment, available for languages with fewer resources?

## Our Solution
Language Revitalization - the attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language, or to revive extinct ones, inspired Bloom. 
It's an app designed to help students like us reconnect with our roots!
